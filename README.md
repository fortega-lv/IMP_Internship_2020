# Sugar Cane Yield Estimation Using Deep Neural Networks

The **general objective** of this lab is to build a deep neural network model to estimate sugar-cane yield in Mexico by using data from the Agrifood and Fisheries Information Service (SIAP) form the Secretary of Agriculture and Rural Development (SAGARPA) and weather data from Daily Surface Weather and Climatological Summaries (DAYMET) form the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC) 

Data extraction, cleaning, pretreatment and a preliminar exploratory data analysis has been performed in previous laboratories (DT02_EDA_Lab_es) in order to select the most relevant crops in Mexico and the most useful features. In this notebook, we will focus our analysis on the three datasets created in the DT02_EDA_Lab_es laboratory

**Topics to discuss**

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Selection 
* Development of Neural Network predictive models
* Performance improvement by Feature Engineering
